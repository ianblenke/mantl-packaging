    # move the existing resolv.conf and direct *all* queries to localhost.
    # dnsmasq will read the resolv.conf.masq and forward traffic accordingly
    #
    # this configuration also adds search paths to resolv.conf so that the
    # system can address nodes by their simplest name (x.node.consul becomes
    # x.node or simply x.) This will work for service addressing as well, so
    # you can use y.service instead of y.service.consul
